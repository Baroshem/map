> Leaflet integration of `@nuxtjs/map` uses this package under the hood <https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet>

Leaflet is an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Weighing just about 39 KB of JS, it has all the mapping features most developers ever need.

Leaflet is designed with simplicity, performance and usability in mind. It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms, can be extended with lots of plugins, has a beautiful, easy to use and well-documented API and a simple, readable source code that is a joy to contribute to.

## Usage

In order to have leaflet as your map provider set the provider option in the configuration options of the `@nuxtjs/map` module to 'leaflet' like following:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  buildModules: [
    '@nuxtjs/map'
  ],
  map: {
    provider: 'leaflet'
  }
})
```

And then, add `nuxt-map` and `nuxt-marker` to your page or component:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <nuxt-map :options="{ center, zoom, attribution }" style="height: 500px">
      <nuxt-marker
        v-for="(marker, i) in markerPositions"
        :key="i"
        :options="{ position: marker }"
        popup="<a href='/''>Hi! I'm staying here on this location!</a>"
      />
    </nuxt-map>
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
const markerPositions = [
  { lat: 40.689247, lng: -74.044502 },
  { lat: 40.689947, lng: -74.044502 },
  { lat: 40.684947, lng: -74.044502 }
]
const center = markerPositions[0]
const zoom = 15

// Leaflet only
const attribution = "<a href='https://blog.safecast.org/about/'>SafeCast</a> (<a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/'>CC-BY-SA</a>"
</script>
```

It should result in the following:
